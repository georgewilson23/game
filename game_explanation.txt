Fall down game -- J Preston Harvey jph8rw , George Wilson gaw8cf

describing what your game is, what your features are that you want us to grade, and how to play it.

The game we created is our version of fall down. The objective is counter-intuitive as the user aims to make the
character fall off the bottom of the screen and avoid getting crushed at the top. Once the game begins,
gravity has an effect and the ball moves down while walls move up to hinder the user's ability to "fall down." The
character interacts with powerups, coins, and bombs along the way.

To play: Press space. Move red character (the ball) around using the left and right arrows. Collect coins, the more
coins you collect, the higher your score is. Avoid walls that push the character to the top. Touching the top means the
game is over. The red/brown squares are bombs, which subtract 5 points from the your score if the you have more
than 5 points. The blue powerup creates a 'magical' wrap so that you can go to the left or right edge of the screen and
pop out on the other side for a limited amount of time. The white power up is a speed powerup that makes left and right
movements faster. The orange powerup clears all the walls for a small amount of time so the ball is able to fall down
easily.

Features to grade:

Enemies: the bomb that hinders the user's ability to get a high score by taking away points
Collectables: coins, speed powerup, clear and wrap powerup
Music/Sound effects: continuous song during game play, powerup sound, coin sound, bomb sound, and end game (splat) sound
Animation: the coins are based on a sprite sheet that animates them so they appear to spin
